# Pagyra PHP

Fresh PHP port of [pagyra-js](https://github.com/celsowm/pagyra-js).

The previous PHP implementation was intentionally removed. From this point forward, `pagyra-js` is the behavioral reference for this project.

## Status

**Reset / planning stage. No rendering implementation exists on `main` yet.**

See [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) for the porting roadmap and parity criteria.

## Goal

Provide a pure-PHP HTML-to-PDF engine whose observable rendering behavior tracks `pagyra-js` as closely as practical, while exposing an idiomatic PHP API.

## Requirements

- PHP >= 8.2
- Composer

## Development rule

A feature is not considered ported because equivalent-looking PHP code exists. It is considered ported only when fixtures shared with `pagyra-js` produce equivalent layout/rendering results within explicitly defined tolerances.
